# Operator Performers View - Flowbite Conversion

## This table is currently implemented as a Flowbite Table. It should be ported to the new table you are creating.

## It could not be used because as of right now, the three dots functionality is broken on the component table.

In this folder, the page implementing this table exists so you can see the way it currently works.
