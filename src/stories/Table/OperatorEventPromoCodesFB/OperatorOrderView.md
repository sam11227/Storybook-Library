# Operator Event Promo Code - Flowbite Conversion

## This table is currently implemented as a Flowbite Table. It should be ported to the new table you are creating.

## It could not be used because as of right now, the three dots functionality is broken on the component table.

Please see the component in src/components/PromoCode/PromoCode.svelte.

Implement this table: https://www.figma.com/design/xEAgeYvJoWIBVwEA5L7EJx/Micdrop?node-id=413-76986&t=yIzpFCbBRzukR7W1-4
