# Operator Bookings Page - Flowbite Conversion

## This view has four distinct tables. They have not yet been ported to our new table as various features must be supported prior to this.

## This is the most complex view in the application. Please tackle this *last*.

## It could not be used because as of right now, the three dots functionality is broken on the component table.

The Bookings page has been consolidated and attached to this folder.

Implement this table: https://www.figma.com/design/xEAgeYvJoWIBVwEA5L7EJx/Micdrop?node-id=413-76986&t=yIzpFCbBRzukR7W1-4
